For a Fixed Rate Loan, the rate of interest is fixed either for the entire tenure of the loan or a certain part of the tenure of the loan. In case of a pure fixed loan, the EMI due to the bank remains constant. If a bank offers a Loan which is fixed only for a certain period of the tenure of the loan, please try to elicit information from the bank whether the rates may be raised after the period (reset clause).

Some banks insist on margin / down payment (borrowers contribution to the creation of an asset) to be maintained / made also.', \n",
    "#                   'In any kind of loan, banks usually finance only up to 90% of the amount. The rest, called margin money, has to be put in by the borrower. The extent of the loan varies between 80-90% of the total amount. So, figure out how much money you will need upfront.', \n",
    "#                   'You may approach three banks for the same loan and they may all charge an interest rate of 9%. But, if you actually compare the EMIs, it might vary. Reason: Different ways of computation. The type of reducing balance method applied or the ‘rests’ in the loan determine the effective cost. The ‘rests’ could be annual, quarterly, monthly or daily. The shorter the ‘rest’, the better is the deal. When the interest is calculated on monthly rests, the principal on which the interest is charged reduces every month. This results in a significant saving over the tenure of the loan. Thus, always compare the EMI of various financiers with a similar amount and tenure.']]]"
